# Laravel for Beginners

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework that is widely used for web application development. It is known for its elegant syntax, tools for common tasks such as routing, authentication, and caching, and its ability to handle high traffic. Laravel follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and includes built-in support for object-relational mapping (ORM) and query builder, making it easy to interact with databases.

This repository contains two different projects: the `crud-demo` project is a basic project demonstrating the model-view-controller architecture and how to create basic CRUD operations using Laravel, and the `blog-demo` project is a full blog application.

These demo projects are created for the [Laravel for Beginners](https://www.ericsdevblog.com/posts/laravel-for-beginners-1/) tutorial:
