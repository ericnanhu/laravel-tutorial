# Beginner’s Roadmap to Web Development

The World Wide Web, commonly known as the Web, is an information and resource sharing system consisting of servers and clients, who are connected together by hyperlinks. The documents and resources of the Web are requested by the browser and then transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which can then be displayed in the browser.

HTML is the fundamental building block of the web, it defines what information each web page should contain, And CSS determines how those data should look on the web page.

JavaScript is the first programming language we are going to introduce in this course. It can be used to make your web page more interactive.

Vue.js is a very beginner-friendly front-end JavaScript framework. It’s a good place to start if you are interested in becoming a front-end engineer.

Now, it is time for us to talk about the back-end. You have two choices, if you prefer PHP, you can go with Laravel. A lot of people have criticisms for PHP, but regardless, it is still the dominant language in the field of web development. And I personally believe Laravel is a very powerful framework. However, if you are more comfortable with Python, you can follow the Django tutorial instead.
